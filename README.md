# 2270_Project_AC
Project for Data Structures

I will be working on this project with Austin Holler.  
We will be working on Creating a program that allows a person to enter in their 23andMe data and the program will analyze the data.  It will give feed back on any predicatble traits or chareteristics that can be deteremined fom their genotype.  We will be creating a class for all the rsid's.  The class will contain a vector.  each position in the vector will contain a struct and a linked list.
